# typescript-telegram-userbot

For self-boting in telegram using [telegram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram) package  
I created this for testing, and i'm writing [setup & run steps](##initialize) if you're interrested so

## Initialize
Clone this repository 
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/al-bimani/typescript-telegram-userbot telebot
```

Change the directory (`cd telebot`) and install the packages  
Use `yarn install` if you're using yarn or `npm install` if you're using npm

Copy the .env.example file to .env, you could use `cp .env.example .env`

## Run
You'll need to set `SESSION` in the .env file  

You can get this by doing the following:
- run the program `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
- Follow the instructions in the terminal
- Copy the token you see there into `SESSION` and save the file
